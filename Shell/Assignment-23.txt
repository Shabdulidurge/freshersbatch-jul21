Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name.
Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable.
Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, 
pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, 
add a calculation of their age in number of days.
-> #!/bin/bash
function u_details {
  first_name=$1
  year=365
  read -p " Enter a message " age
  echo “ $age ”
  days=$((age * year))
  echo " Dear $first_name your age is $age in days are $days "
}
