Write a script that will use command substitution to dynamically set variable values:

TODAYSDATE - should contain date/time stamp when executed
USERFILES - the results of a find run on the /home directory to list all files owned by 'user' account


Additionally, set two aliases:

TODAY - should be an alias for the 'date' command
UFILES - should be an alias to the full command used to set the variable USERFILES above

Finally, display all variables and alias values when the script is run.
-> echo "ENter the date"
read date
echo "$date"
echo "Enter the detile of files"
read list
echo "$list"

OR we can write
USERFILES="${HOME}*.txt" for creating Userfile
#
alias [name[=value]]
alias UFILES=""
