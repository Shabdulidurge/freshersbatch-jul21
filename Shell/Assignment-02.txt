Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

-> MYUSERNAME=shabduli
MYPASSWORD=shabd
#
y=date
STARTOFSCRIPT=$(date +%T)
ENDOFSCRIPT=$(date +%T)
#
echo " MYUSERNAME :$MYUSERNAME"
echo " MYPASSWORD : $MYPASSWORD "
echo " STARTOFSCRIPT : $STARTOFSCRIPT "
echo " ENDOFSCRIPT : $ENDOFSCRIPT "
