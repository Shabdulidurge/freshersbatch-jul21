Create a simple script containing a single function. 
This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. 
Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.
-> function print_fn{
	echo "Inside print function"
}
echo "before calling print function"
print_fn
echo "After calling the print function"
