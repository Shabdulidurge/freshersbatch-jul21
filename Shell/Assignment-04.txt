Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.

-> #!/bin/bash
echo " But as your case also shows (from what I read in the comments) this is a risky thing to do, as it cloaks errors you might have in your code. "I want this script to never print error messages" should only be said when one knows all possible error cases which could possibly occur. "
echo " Of course, the redirection only works for the command it is applied to " 2>/dev/null
