Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run.
Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, 
what each command is doing.

-> #!/bin/bash
var1=10 #creating and initializing the variable 1
var2=20  #creating and initializing the variable 2
echo " $var1 is the variable one " #c printing the var1
echo " $var2 is the variable two " #c printing the var2
